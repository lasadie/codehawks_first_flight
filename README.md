## First Flights
My smart contract auditing learning journey. Please note the following:

1. These are intentionally vulnerable smart contracts for practicing smart contract auditing and should not be used in production. 

2. This repository contains my shadow audit reports for CodeHawk's First Flights. They are named as `audit_report.md` in the respective directory.

3. Please note that the vulnerabilities are not completely identified to 100%, and this audit is not comprehensive or exhaustive in any way.

4. The identified vulnerabilities are what I have identified during my practice sessions and it may contain vulnerabilities that are invalidated by the content judges.
